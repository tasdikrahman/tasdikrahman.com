This post was long overdue!

We have been working on building a food recommendation system for some time and this phase involved getting the menu items from the menu images

We poured over at zomato's site looking for menu's and all we found was images in the name of menu's

This is not what we wanted! 

> We want the menu items tp be in text format, so that we can easily track which restaurants are serving which dish and analyze the reviews to see which restaurant serves best

### Scrape them all!

The first step was to scrape the images of the hotels.

The very first apps which came to our mind when we thought about food were no other than [zomato](https://zomato.com) and [burrp](http://burrp.com) (brownie points for those for whom these were the names echoing in their minds).

Zomato kept blocking our `crawlers` from time to time. So we found **burrp** to be a boon in this sense.

>You can find some of the webscrapers here [(https://github.com/foodoh/web_scrapers)](https://github.com/foodoh/web_scrapers)

### Enter OCR

So the obvious choice was to apply `image processing` techniques so as to extract the text inside these images

We thought we would be getting okayish results using the [tesseract-ocr engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr) for this purpose. If you haven't heard about it. `tesseract` is maitained by [google](http://google.com) and provides a decent API for getting the job done!

We ran some of our images on it wihout any pre-processing and waited for the result. But we were in for a rude shock. Not only were we getting bad results but some of them were outright garbage text

Tell me if you can comprehend any of this

This is supposed to be the text list of menu items extraced from this image

Sucks right?

But some results were turning out fine. Take for instance this image [(link)](https://github.com/foodoh/ocrd_menus/blob/master/menu_images/1947-fine-indian-cuisine-banashankari-listing/1947-fine-indian-cuisine-banashankari-listing_1.jpg)

### Grayscaling the images 

Now after some reading, we found out that grayscaling the images according would increase the OCR accuracy.

A simple `PIL` program for that

<script src="https://gist.github.com/tasdikrahman/06239ec6986ce3d05b4dfd00cc038372.js"></script>

This improved the accuracy to a certain extent. Here is a sample greyscaled image for you [(link)](https://github.com/foodoh/scraped_menu_items/blob/master/light_cleaned_images/100-ft-boutique-bar-restaurant-indiranagar-listing/100-ft-boutique-bar-restaurant-indiranagar-listing_1_cleaned.jpg)

> Some of the cleaning scripts lie here [(https://github.com/foodoh/image_cleansing/)](https://github.com/foodoh/image_cleansing/)

### Automating the task of OCR

Now tesseract was provinding a `CLI` interface for interacting with it. But how would you automate this? I am not gonna sit there and type 

```bash
 $ tesseract myscan.png out
```

for each and every image scraped!

> Enter python!

As always. `python` comes to the rescue. I wrote a simple script which ran over the image directories, looping over each and every image for each hotel and ran `tesseract-ocr` on them. 

Storing of each hotel's text menu was done in a different file with the name that file being the hotel's normalized name.

You can find most of the scripts used for this automation here

Stay tuned for more!
