# Context

Wanted to pick ideas from folks who have worked in such setups effectively/led teams over the years across geographical continents. Given I recently took up a fully remote role, with the team that I am joining being spread across EU and in the US as of now.

This post is just for documentary purposes for me to look back how I have fared over the course of this year and the next as I take this journey of working in a remote first company.

## Takeaways from my discussion with a couple of folks.

- different machines for work and personal work
- respecting your own boundaries of fixed time slots/work times which you work in the day.
- having 1-1's with folks in your team and your other team members who work with you from other teams.
- written first communication
- meet personally in the office helps further while working remotely.
- talking with your respective manager to get a sense of how they want to drive the working style of the team and how they want you to work.
- see what are you trying to balance along with your work times and see how they align and make sure you communicate it.
- 1-1 with your manager is you time since this is for the reportee to convey concerns/ideas to the person you are reporting to
- not checking work devices frequently outside of work hours.
- understand the set of practices already being followed by your team, if it has already been working remotely for sometime and follow them
