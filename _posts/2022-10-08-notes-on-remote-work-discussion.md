# Context

Wanted to pick ideas from folks who have worked effectively/led teams over the years across geographical continents. Given I recently took up a fully remote role, with the team that I am joining being spread across EU and in the US.

And this would also be the first time I am starting work in a fully remote setup. Wanted to see what have folks figured out by doing this way and learning along the way.

This post is just for documentary purposes for me to look back how I have fared over the course of this year and the next as I take this journey of working in a remote first company.

## Takeaways from my discussion with a couple of folks.

- different machines for work and personal work
- not respecting your own boundaries of fixed time slots/work times which you work in the day.
- having 1-1's with folks in your team and your other team members who work with you from other teams.
- written first communication
- meet personally in the office helps further while working remotely.
- talking with your respective manager to get a sense of how they want to drive the working style of the team and how they want you to work.
- see what are you trying to balance along with your work times and see how they align and make sure you communicate it.
- 1-1 with your manager is you time since this is for the reportee to convey concerns/ideas to the person you are reporting to
- checking work devices frequently outside of work hours.
