title: About Me
---

This site is a partial collection of projects I've worked on, stories I've written down and software I've published.

A generalist developer, with a focus on the infrastructure side of things. I love working on building systems and software which help the developers become more efficient by abstracting out infrastructure and making it simpler for them, so that it gets out of their way. In that process, I pick up the language(s)/tool(s), which make the most sense for the task at hand, but I do have a soft spot for [python](https://python.org/), [golang](https://golang.org) and [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) these days.

When I'm not working on a [side project](https://github.com/tasdikrahman), I can be found playing football (soccer if you may) or [cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/38551461) and watching EPL (Go Chelsea!). I am very fond of [backpacking](https://tasdikrahman.me/blog/tag/travel/), within and outside India. I also love attending theatre performances and have been trying to improve my skills at [Argentine tango](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_tango). You might find me with a [book/kindle](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19151223-tasdik-rahman) if we stumble upon each other.

A list of public talks given by me, can be found [here](https://tasdikrahman.me/speaking/).

I am always a [tweet](https://twitter.com/tasdikrahman) away if you have something interesting in mind.

If you are an `IRC` person, I will be there with the handle `tasdikrahman` hanging around OFTC as well as on freenode.

_I write about a lot of things on this blog, but it doesn't and has never represented the opinion of any of my employers. This is a personal blog I write in my off-hours_
