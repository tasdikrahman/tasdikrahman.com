title: About Me
---

This site is a partial collection of projects I've worked on, stories I've written down and software I've published.

A generalist developer, with a focus on the infrastructure side of things.

I enjoy [bouldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering), dancing Salsa, reading books and heading over to [Union FC's](https://www.fc-union-berlin.de/en/) football matches regularly. [Backpacking](https://tasdikrahman.me/blog/tag/travel/) is something which I am very fond.

A list of public talks given by me, can be found [here](https://www.tasdikrahman.com/speaking/).

I am always a [tweet](https://twitter.com/tasdikrahman) away if you have something interesting in mind.

If you are an `IRC` person, I will be there with the handle `tasdikrahman` hanging around OFTC as well as on freenode.

_I write about a lot of things on this blog, but it doesn't and has never represented the opinion of any of my employers. This is a personal blog I write in my off-hours_
